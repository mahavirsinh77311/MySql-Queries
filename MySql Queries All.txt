1) Create a select single query to get all employee name, all hobby_name in single column

SELECT concat(first_name, ' ', last_name )as employee_name
FROM employee
UNION 
SELECT name as employee_name
FROM hobby;

2) Create a select query to get  employee name, his/her employee_salary

 SELECT concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) as employee_name, es.salary
FROM employee as e 
JOIN employee_salary as es ON es.fk_employee_id = e.id
order by es.salary DESC

3) Create a select query to get employee name, total salary of employee, hobby name(comma-separated - you need to use subquery for hobby name).

SELECT CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name)  AS employee_name, 
      sum(  es.salary) AS total_salary, 
      (select  GROUP_CONCAT( distinct h.name) from hobby h
      inner JOIN employee_hobby  ON h.id = eh.fk_hobby_id) as hobbies
FROM employee_hobby AS eh 
right JOIN employee AS e ON e.id = eh.fk_employee_id    
left JOIN employee_salary AS es ON es.fk_employee_id = e.id
GROUP BY e.id;

1. Get name (firstname + lastname), department name, country name, job name

select concat(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name)as employee_name, 
d.name as department,
 (select  GROUP_CONCAT( distinct c.name) from country c
      inner JOIN department  ON c.id = d.fk_country_id) as country, j.name as job
from employee as e
inner join department as d on d.id= e.fk_department_id
inner join job as j on j.id= e.fk_job_id
group by e.id;

2. Get 2nd highest salary of the employee

SELECT concat(first_name,' ', last_name) as employee_name,  MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary 
FROM employee 
WHERE salary <> (SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employee);


3. Get all job name and department name in single query

SELECT concat(name)as job_name
FROM job
UNION
